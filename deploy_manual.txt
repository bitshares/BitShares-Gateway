TODO:  create writeup for deploying the gateway... here's the short and skinny:

0) there is currently no setup.py; you must manually install the modules listed in requirements.txt

1) review all code, this is open source financial software without warranty; you alone are responsible for your use of this script

2) block_exporers.py will open up 3rd party web based block explorers which can be used to watch transactions

3) run all unit_test scripts.   Also several of the module component scripts contain onboard unit test which can be run via the main().  These should be run prior to depoying the gateway.

3) The gateway has a nodes.py and config.py  be sure to fill these forms out with the pertinent information.

4) Gateway.py is the primary gateway script, running this script will launch the gateway.
