Graphene Python Gateway

Built in collaboration with bitshares.org

This is the primary script to be launched by the gateway admin, in terminal:

    python3 Gateway.py

Launches 3 concurrent run forever processes:

    1) WITHDRAW AND RESERVE PROCESS

    listen for incoming uia to gateway address via graphene listener
        confirm the transfer memo is a legit foreign chain address
            initiate withdrawal transfer of foreign chain tokens to client
            listen to foreign chain to confirm transfer
                reserve uia

    2) DEPOSIT AND ISSUE PROCESS

    provide web api for client to request gateway deposit address
        provide a unique address to deposit foreign tokens
            listen for incoming foreign tokens
                issue uia

    3) INGOT PROCESS

    periodically check foreign chain gateway wallets
        upon finding too many small dust amounts
            consolidate ingots
